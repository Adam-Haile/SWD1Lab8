ParkingLot program  

Assignment:  
You have been hired to implement an API for a number of parking lots in a district. Someone else is developing hardware to detect when vehicles enter or leave each lot, and you are writing classes that will be used by the hardware to measure lot usage. In particular, you are writing two classes: ParkingLot to track the number of vehicles in an individual lot, and District to track the lots in the parking district.  

A design team has specified the API. This API is partially documented in the following class diagram. You will implement a class ParkingLot consistent with this diagram. You can add attributes and private methods, but you must implement the methods (with the specified parameters) as shown. The key operations are markVehicleEntry and markVehicleExit which are called when vehicles enter or exit a lot. These take a timestamp parameter which is the number of minutes since the lot opened. The design team has also written part of District.java with stubs for the portions that you need to write. Again, you may add private attributes and methods as required, but you must stay consistent with the diagram.
